# Yoti Technical Test

This repository contains the technical test required for the iOS role in Yoti. 

**Document version 1.1.0**

## Context

Our experience has showed us that there are many cases in companies where a solution is implemented without proper technical design and review. What we wanted to achieve with this exercise is to create a rather bad project and simulate such a situation. What we would like from you is to identify the issues and resolve them.

## Instructions

Please read the following instructions before you proceed completing the exercise / test. In case you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us.

For the completion of the exercise we are expecting from you to do the following:
- Clone and commit the project locally
- Create a patch file with your changes
- (Optional) In case you would like to provide further expanation on your solution you can attach a separate document in PDF format.

**Things to avoid**
- Fork the project
- Submit a Pull Request on the repo
- Comment on any of the issues or Existing Pull Requests
- Submit a solution made by someone else

## MyFirstSlideshow

The application is a rather simple one. It consists of one screen and it's divided in two areas. Each area should display in sequence an array of 4 images.

The images we would like to load are the following:

## Exercise

The exercise is described under the issues tab on the github project. Every issue will contain instructions on the specifications and requirements. **You don't need to deliver each solution separately**. It's perfectly acceptable if you prefer to deliver on result that contains the fix for bith issues.

What we would like from you:
- Re-implement the project as if the feature was given to you.
- You are not requested to implement a completely different design unless you want to but the UI elements implemented should be flexible enough to be re-used.  
- Donâ€™t use any external frameworks. We would like to see your problem solving skills and a third party framework is not going to help.  
- We completely understand and respect your time so in case you need more time, please email us.
- Don't consider this as a speed contest. Quality and Speed should be balanced and we definitely prefer you taking the full allocated time and send us a better solution than rushing for a solution which is sub-optimal.
- Send us your commit logs attached with your answer.
